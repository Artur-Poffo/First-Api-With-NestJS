# My First API REST With Nest.js:

> Status: Version: 1.0.0

My first REST API with NestJS, my first impressions were that the NestJS CLI is very handy and that it's a little strange to use an opined Frame Work after using express for so long, but it's pretty cool and practical (minus the configuration part of environment variables)

## Technologies:
- NodeJS
- NestJS
- TypeScript
- MongoDB with mongoose
- ESlint and Prettier
